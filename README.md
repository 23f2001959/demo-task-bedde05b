# Project: Demo Task

## Summary:
This project is a fully functional browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented using JavaScript. The game supports two players with turns, implements snakes and ladders rules, and contains 'Roll Dice' and 'Reset Game' buttons.

## Setup:
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage:
1. Click on the 'Roll Dice' button to roll the dice.
2. Move your token based on the number rolled.
3. If you land on a ladder, you will move up, and if you land on a snake, you will move down.
4. The game continues until one player reaches the final square.
5. Click on the 'Reset Game' button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation:
The HTML file contains the structure of the game board along with buttons for rolling the dice and resetting the game. The JavaScript file controls the game logic, including moving the player tokens, checking for snakes and ladders, and determining the winner.
